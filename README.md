# LISA - The Quadruped Robot 🤖 🐕‍🦺

**LISA** is a smaller version replica of the [**Boston Dynamics Spot**](https://www.bostondynamics.com/products/spot) Robot. We are inspired by the working and functioning of the **Spot** and started working on this smaller version. The Aim 🎯 of the Project is to make a smaller version of **Spot** but with minimal affordable electronic components and hardware 🧰. 

## 1. CAD Models of LISA

The CAD Models of LISA are being designed in Autodesk's Fusion 360.

## 2. Rendered LISA

The Assembled drawings are later being rendered with Pi and other components.

## 3. Additive Manufactured Parts and Tools 🧰

The choice of materials for the robot depends on your dimensions 📏, pricing 💰, load 🏋️ of the robot 🤖, size and capacity of your motors, and other factors. These are our additive manufactured parts before cleaning.

## 4. Assemble of Parts 📦

At this stage, the parts are cleaned with salt paper, fixed with the ball bearings, servo motors, and some screws 🪛 . Test out the individual part before proceeding to the next stage.

## 5. Simulation of LISA 🤖


The LISA model 🤖 is a reasonably priced fully simulated quadruped robot developed using pyBullet 🐍 that can be controlled with remote Bluetooth controllers 🎮 like PS4 or XBOX can be used in both the rough and 🌳 tough terrain environments. The Robot is used to monitor the terrain environments where humans are unable to pass through and handle various works accordingly. The Gait patterns implemented here depict the original beings 🐕 to mimic them. Improved stability provides the robot to wake up immediately after a dash or a fall.

## 6. Special features ✨

Special features like motion simulation, cam feed recording 🔴, snapshots 🖼️, storing the feed onto the storage device 💿, heatmap generation, live streaming 📷 are implemented.

The Robot 🤖 can be extended to use in excavation sites, and monitoring areas 🖥️. The Interfaced Webcam provides the feed of the surroundings to the owner several feet away. Further software improvements can provide features like facial recognition 🌝, object detection 🏀, and intruder detection.
